/** iCloud Document Sync helps integrate iCloud into iOS (OS X coming soon) Objective-C document projects with one-line code methods. Sync, upload, manage, and remove documents to and from iCloud with only a few lines of code (compared to the 400+ lines that it usually takes). Updates and more details on this project can be found on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync). If you like the project, please [star it](https://github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync) on GitHub!
 
 The `iCloud` class provides methods to integrate iCloud into document projects.
 
 <br />
 Adding iCloud Document Sync to your project is easy. Follow these steps below to get everything up and running.
 
 1. Drag the iCloud Framework into your project
 2. Add `#import <iCloud/iCloud.h>` to your header file(s) iCloud Document Sync
 3. Subscribe to the `<iCloudDelegate>` delegate.
 4. Call the following methods to setup iCloud when your app starts:
 
        iCloud *cloud = [[iCloud alloc] init]; // This will help to begin the sync process and register for document updates.
        [cloud setDelegate:self]; // Only set this if you plan to use the delegate
 
 
 @warning Only available on iOS 5.0 and later on apps with valid code signing and entitlements.

/** @name Uploading to iCloud */

 @discussion iCloud Document Sync uses UIDocument and NSData to store and manage files. All of the heavy lifting with NSData and UIDocument is handled for you. There's no need to actually create or manage any files, just give iCloud Document Sync your data, and the rest is done for you.
 
 To create a new document or save an existing one (close the document), use this method. Below is a code example of how to use it.
 
    [iCloud saveDocumentWithName:@"Name.ext" withContent:[NSData data] withDelegate:self completion:^(UIDocument *cloudDocument, NSData *documentData, NSError *error) {

        }
    }];
 
 
 @param name The name of the UIDocument file being written to iCloud
 @param content The data to write to the UIDocument file
 @param handler Code block called when the document is successfully saved. The completion block passes UIDocument and NSData objects containing the saved document and it's contents in the form of NSData. The NSError object contains any error information if an error occurred, otherwise it will be nil.

/** Upload any local files that weren't created with iCloud or were created while offline
 
 @discussion Files in the local documents directory that do not already exist in iCloud will be **moved** into iCloud one by one. This process involves lots of file manipulation and as a result it may take a long time. This process will be performed on the background thread to avoid any lag or memory problems. When the upload processes end, the completion block is called on the main thread.
